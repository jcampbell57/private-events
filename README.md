# Odin Private Events

This is a rails app with a PostgreSQL database which allows users to:
* Create events with a set time and location that can be attended by many users
* Manage user signups
* Send invitations
* Attend many events

More project info:
* Ruby version 3.2.2

One of the trickiest aspects of this assignment for me was figuring out the associations. This part of the rails guides was helpful:
* https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#controller-namespaces-and-routing

This was a tough assignment, but I think essential to start learning how to work with rails associations. 

Extra Credit:
